CHANGES DONE THIS WEEK (Vel.py and VelPredicate.py)
- Created a function to map the predicate names to their respective classes.
- Improved the Dash app to display a dropdown of predicates and dynamically generate input fields based on selected predicates (for all the predicates)
- Worked on the logic of running the predicates based on the user input with the Logview library.
- Worked on Displaying the Output of the Query.
- WIP - Constructing the Querry (with an addition of Buttons,etc to run it)

- TODO : Testing of the functionalities (next week) and with different datasets.

To Run this app, go to velUi.ipynb and add the path for logview source code and run the cells.
